<i>DevFeed is a news feed that is designed for the user to enjoy and establish their own experience. It's all about you</i>

I was inspired to start creating DevFeed after signing up for the dev.daily newsfeed extension. This extension ultimately created a homepage on newly opened tabs that were centered around providing me with the latest news and information in software development. Unfortunately, this extension was not what I was looking for; leaving me out to find another source for news and information. Then, I came up with the idea of creating my own news feed that I can filter exactly what I want to see when I want to see it. Thus, DevFeed was born. While incomplete, I plan to make DevFeed into something that all developers can utilize to craft and self-cater whatever news or feeds they wish to see themselves. Eliminating the need to sign up to numerous newsletters and newsfeeds.
